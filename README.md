# ForkPPM
This presentation is a collaborative project that will be presented as a 15 minute pitch at the DCCN Project Proposal Meeting, a meeting at the [Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour](http://www.ru.nl/donders).

The goals of this project are:
- to create a [GitPitch](https://gitpitch.com) template for future Donders PPMs
- to make a humurous 15 minute example presentation about a request for forks in the Donders Kitchen
  - lame jokes referring to GitHub forks are much appreciated
- to be a fun way of get neuroscientists to use GitHub
- to be a way to see if [Gitcoin](gitcoin.co) could be useful for incentivising the collaboration

Pull Requests will preferably be accepted from users that are part of the [Donders Institute Team](https://github.com/orgs/Donders-Institute). How does it work?
